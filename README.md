Tail Tales is a web- based application that promises to solve the problem of scheduling veterinary medical appointments. This project has two main objectives. The initial one is to give
people access to a website where they can easily schedule appointments at their convenient time slot for clinic visits or request a veterinarian to visit them at their residence to examine their pet.
The subsequent goal is to lessen the discomfort of the typical booking system by permitting users to make reservations online and skip standing in lengthy queues to check in.
